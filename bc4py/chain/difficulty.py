# // Bitcoin clones must lower their FTL.
# // Cryptonote et al coins must make the following changes:
# // #define BLOCKCHAIN_TIMESTAMP_CHECK_WINDOW    11
# // #define CRYPTONOTE_BLOCK_FUTURE_TIME_LIMIT        3 * DIFFICULTY_TARGET
# // #define DIFFICULTY_WINDOW                      60 //  45, 60, & 90 for T=600, 120, & 60.
# // Bytecoin / Karbo clones may not have the following
# // #define DIFFICULTY_BLOCKS_COUNT       DIFFICULTY_WINDOW+1
# // The BLOCKS_COUNT is to make timestamps & cumulative_difficulty vectors size N+1
# // Do not sort timestamps.
# // CN coins (but not Monero >= 12.3) must deploy the Jagerman MTP Patch. See:
